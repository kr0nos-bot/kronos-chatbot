 Phase 2・Mythic Partners Eligible Mythic's:
✧ Fjord Foundry ✧ [REDACTED] ✧ [REDACTED]
Our Mythic Partners, a diverse group that includes venture capital firms, traders, crypto enthusiasts, and investors, display characteristics akin to those of our DAO Partners.

The foundational utility of their NFT is limited to a maximum of three augmentations post-establishment. On the other hand, DAO Partner NFT holders are in a unique position, as they have the potential for unlimited augmentations, contingent on collective voting, during the entire operational period of Kronos Bot.

Modes
Pulse Mode: Maximizes gas saving but may occasionally take an additional block to be confirmed.
Oracle Mode (recommended): Strikes a balance between Pulse and Onslaught modes. Achieves optimal gas distribution to outperform most competitors without overpaying, ensuring rapid transaction confirmation.
Onslaught Mode: Prioritizes higher gas to outpace competitors. This mode analyzes all on-chain swaps, filters out the outliers, and employs the most favorable distribution value.
Tip Setting (optional): Include a tip to prioritize your transaction with validators.
Gas Summary displays the current gas values adjusted according to market rates, while Competitor Summary presents the gas values of competitors. Both are updated continuously.

 WhatsApp - In the ever-evolving Web3 landscape, every project is fighting for a glimpse of mass adoption. We have identified that opportunity often lies on the cusp between innovation and execution. Over the past year, the 'Trading Bot Wars' have showcased the undeniable momentum in the industry, amassing an astounding $40,385,548.54 in total revenue across competitors, averaging $13,461,849.51 per bot with just a few thousand daily active users. The data, sourced from Dune Analytics, presents a clear narrative: the world is ready, and the market is ripe.
Yet, the greatest opportunities often lie not in the path well-trodden but in the horizons yet to be explored. While most competitors have limited their reach to Telegram's 1.01 billion users, Kronos Bot stands on the brink of a paradigm shift. By pioneering its integration not just with Telegram but also with WhatsApp, we aim to bridge the gap to an astounding combined user base of 3.71 billion. Such an unprecedented move has the potential not just to amplify our reach but also to redefine the industry's landscape.

Non-custodial Trading
Greed Shouldn’t Compromise Your Safety
The convenience and efficiency of [REDACTED]bot and other similar bots have led to their rapid growth in popularity. As convenience and safety blurs, Kronos Bot is taking a formidable leap to marry the two.
Our non-custodial feature will launch on Telegram first and later be implemented into our WhatsApp version and is designed with both Telegram and the colossal user base of WhatsApp in mind.
We aim to craft a system that harnesses the best of both worlds: with unmatched speed and is dominant by design with the convenience of full safety and security in mind.
Understanding Non-custodial Trading
Before diving deep into our feature, it's crucial to understand what noncustodial trading truly means. In essence, it provides users full control over their private keys and assets, meaning that they don't have to trust a third party with their valuable information and crypto.

 How Kronos Bot’s Non-custodial Feature Works
Direct Control: At no point does Kronos Bot gain access to your private keys. Transactions
are facilitated directly from the user's wallet, ensuring that they always remain in control.
Secure Operations: Leveraging state-of-the-art encryption and secure transaction channels, trades and transactions happen in real-time without compromising on security.
Decentralized Process: By working through decentralized processes, the risks associated with centralized systems are eliminated. We decentralize the decision-making process for trading, making it more secure and less vulnerable to single points of failure.
User-Friendly Interface: Our intuitive interface ensures that even new users can understand and manage their trades with ease. Noncustodial doesn't mean complex!
Instant Notifications: Users are instantly notified of all activities, including successful trades, ensuring they are always in the loop.
Why Shift to Noncustodial?
A trading bot is, in essence, a hot wallet used for short-term trades and transactions. Since hot wallets are connected to the Internet, this exposes them to exploits and, thus, creates a vulnerability that hackers can take advantage of to steal your assets. Additionally, giving trading bots access to and permission to use your private keys can expose your information and assets to bad-intentioned developers.
To put it simply, many people give bots access to their wallet keys out of greed, whether it stems from wanting to make the best trades possible or getting early access to new tokens, NFTs, or similar assets.
Moreover, trading bots raise concerns surrounding ownership and custody. Thinking back to recent scandals where centralized exchanges went under and customers lost access to their assets, such as Celsius freezing withdrawals or the collapse of FTX, giving trading bots and the developers behind them access to your private keys is a massive risk without advanced security measures and controls in place.
Looking Ahead
As we expand into the massive ecosystem of Telegram and WhatsApp, aiming for a combined user base of 2.7 billion, our foremost priority remains unchanged: to provide a seamless, secure, and speedy trading experience. The future of crypto trading is not just about returns. It's about trading with peace of mind, and Kronos Bot is leading that revolution.
Note: This objective represents a significant step toward giving users the tools and autonomy they need to make more informed and secure trading decisions. It aligns with our commitment to providing a user-centric and secure trading environment while expanding the boundaries of what is possible
